# Projects

### Analyzing movie data from MovieLens

This project is Alura's Data Science training. This is a film data analysis project in which exploratory data analysis is carried out, visualization of graphics by category, visualization refinement and statistical data such as mean, median, standard deviation, boxplot, histograms, central tendency and dispersion.

Requirements and installation:

- Seaborn's version
```bash
  !pip install seaborn==0.9.0
```
- Libraries used:
```bash
  import pandas as pd
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import seaborn as sns
```
Learnings:
- Import data in csv format with pandas using `pd.read_csv`;
- Extract information from data using Series like `unique`, `value_counts`, `describe`;
- Plot different types of graphs like `plot`, `boxplot`, `distplot` and configure these graphs with `matplotlib.pyplot`;
- Group the data with `groupyby` to perform operations for each group;
- Convert a Series to a DataFrame with `to_frame`;
- Plot data using `sns.catplot`.
